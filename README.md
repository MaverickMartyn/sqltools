# SqlTools
SQL syntax highlighting and completion for string literals in Visual Studio.

## Why the fork?
This project was forked from [mojtabakaviani/sqltools](https://github.com/mojtabakaviani/sqltools), and includes a fix from [abdonkov/sqltools](https://github.com/abdonkov/sqltools).  
I wanted some improvements, and the original repository seemed a bit stale.  
Some of the additional changes include, but are not limited to:
* Highlighting of single- and multi-line comments.
* Auto-completion suggestions only show up when the cursor is inside a string literal.
* Project updated to remove remnants of older project formats.
* General code clean-up and misc. minor fixes.

The latest release can be found on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaverickMartyn.sqltools-improved).
